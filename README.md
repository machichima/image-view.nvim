# image-wezterm-tmux.nvim

## Description

> Still lots of bugs exist ðŸ˜¢

A small plugin to display image using `imgcat` in wezterm and show in split term in tmux.

I develop this as I am using Windows wsl2 and fail to use `image.nvim` plugin (do not know why, but I cannot make it work).

Also add obsidian support for rendering image in wiki link format
